## Review guidelines

- Prefer minimal, high-confidence changes.
- Don’t introduce new dependencies unless necessary.
- Ensure tests run (pytest) and update/add tests when fixing bugs.
- Avoid logging sensitive data / file paths to local data roots.
- Keep matching/scoring rules explicit and documented in docs/.
